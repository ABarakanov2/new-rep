[Chorus: over hook]
It's times like these that make me say
Lord if you see me please come my way
Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid
Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip)
Sometimes I fall I slip
My heartfelt desire be more like you
Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do

[Verse One: Coffee]
I'm on an island by my lonesome stranded
Low key and stayin' candid
Reflect on all the things I try my hand at
Search for the equations to persuasions I'm used to
Finding comfort in the zones of closet bones I get loose to
A mountainous fountain
Spinnin' and monsoonin', grinnin' it's high octane
Explosive how I came
Rollin' down hills 'cause life's a hassle
Encircled by my folly like a moat surround a castle
Stay afloat, catch a second wind
Thin
Is the air I breathe
Teary eyed nose runnin' wipe the snot on my sleeve
I'm callin' on the Savior to be all that I need
Please forgive me my behavior had me lost at light speed

[Chorus: over hook]
It's times like these that make me say
Lord if you see me please come my way
Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you paid
Feel me like a fingertip (fa-finger tip, fa-finger tip)
Sometimes I fall I slip
My heartfelt desire be more like you
Tryin' not to quench your fire with the things I do
